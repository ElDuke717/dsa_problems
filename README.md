# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains the implementation of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.  It is intended to be used as a reference for me and others learning data structures and algorithms.  It is also a source of example problems for reference and practice, but also for an application that I'm building with Svelte to help me learn Svelte and to help others learn data structures and algorithms.

The end goal is to have an app that will function like a textbook or reference for Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Introduction

### What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently.  It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.  Data structures are used to organize data to suit a specific purpose.  For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.
