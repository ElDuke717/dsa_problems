# Sumpossible

To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. This is often used for problems where you have to make a series of decisions that depend on each other, like whether to include a number in the sum. The approach for `sumPossible` is to create a table that keeps track of whether it's possible to get to a certain amount using any combination of the numbers you have.

Here's the idea:

- Initialize an array (let's call it `dp`) with a length of `amount + 1` and set all values to `false`. This array will keep track of whether it's possible to achieve a certain amount (index) with the given numbers.
- Set `dp[0]` to `true` because you can always make the sum `0` by choosing no numbers.
- Loop through each number in the given array, and for each number, update the `dp` array from `number` to `amount`. If `dp[i - number]` is `true`, then set `dp[i]` to `true`.

Here's what the code might look like:

```javascript
const sumPossible = (amount, numbers) => {
  // Initialize the dp array with false and set dp[0] to true
  const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(false);
  dp[0] = true;

  // Go through each number
  for (let num of numbers) {
    // Update the dp table for each amount from num to amount
    for (let i = num; i <= amount; i++) {
      if (dp[i - num]) dp[i] = true;
    }
  }

  return dp[amount];
};

console.log(sumPossible(8, [5, 12, 4])); // -> true, because 4 + 4 = 8
console.log(sumPossible(15, [6, 2, 10, 19])); // -> false, no combination can add up to 15
console.log(sumPossible(0, [])); // -> true, you can make 0 by choosing no numbers
console.log(sumPossible(12, [12])); // -> true, 12 is directly in the array
console.log(sumPossible(13, [3, 5])); // -> true, because 3 + 5 + 5 = 13
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n \* m), where n is the amount and m is the length of the numbers array, because it potentially iterates over the entire `dp` array for each number in the `numbers` array.

Here's a step by step explanation of the `sumPossible` function:

```javascript
const sumPossible = (amount, numbers) => {
```

This line declares a function `sumPossible` that takes in two parameters: `amount`, which is the target sum you want to achieve, and `numbers`, which is an array of numbers you can use to sum up to the `amount`.

```javascript
const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(false);
```

Here, you're creating an array `dp` with a length of `amount + 1`. You're doing `amount + 1` because you want to include an entry for `0` all the way up to the `amount` itself. You fill this array with `false` initially because you haven't found a way to sum up to any of these amounts yet.

```javascript
dp[0] = true;
```

You set `dp[0]` to `true` because you can always reach a sum of `0` by selecting no numbers from the array (this is sometimes referred to as the base case in dynamic programming).

```javascript
  for (let num of numbers) {
```

This line starts a loop that goes through each `num` in your `numbers` array.

```javascript
    for (let i = num; i <= amount; i++) {
```

Within this loop, you start another loop that will go from the current number `num` to the `amount`. This is because you can only start considering sums that include `num` from `num` itself up to `amount`.

```javascript
if (dp[i - num]) dp[i] = true;
```

For each `i`, you check if `dp[i - num]` is `true`. If it is, it means you can reach the sum `i - num` by using the numbers you have. Since you are currently considering `num`, adding `num` to `i - num` gives you `i`. So, if you can reach `i - num`, you can definitely reach `i` by including `num`. Therefore, you set `dp[i]` to `true`.

For instance, if `num` is `4` and `i` is `8`, you're checking if you can make `4` (`8 - 4`), and if you can, then you can also make `8` by adding the `4`.

After the loops finish running, your `dp` array will have `true` at every index `i` that can be formed by summing the numbers in the `numbers` array.

```javascript
  return dp[amount];
};
```

At the end of the function, you return the value of `dp[amount]`. If it's `true`, then you can form the `amount` by summing the numbers. If it's `false`, then you cannot.

```javascript
console.log(sumPossible(8, [5, 12, 4])); // -> true, because 4 + 4 = 8
```

This calls the function with a target sum of `8` and an array of numbers `[5, 12, 4]`. The function will return `true` because you can sum `4` twice to get `8`.

```javascript
console.log(sumPossible(15, [6, 2, 10, 19])); // -> false, no combination can add up to 15
```

This tries to form `15` with `[6, 2, 10, 19]`, which is not possible, so it returns `false`.

The remaining `console.log` statements are further test cases for the `sumPossible` function.

I hope this breakdown helps clarify how the `sumPossible` function is working. If you have any further questions about specific lines or concepts, feel free to ask!
